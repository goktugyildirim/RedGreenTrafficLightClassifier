# RedGreenTrafficLightClassifier
Red and green traffic light classifier:

I developed a model that can classify red and green traffic ligths for self-driving car concepts, by using pre-trained Resnet50 PyTorch model.
Model: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Qwbf78Mw5ZFLJ6lRNyIloBZ1chsUUtHQ .The model must take image as an input: (1, 3, 224, 224).
Test Accuracy: %95
